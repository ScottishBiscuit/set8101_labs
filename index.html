            <h2>Introduction to Snake</h2>
            <p>
                Snake is one of the first video games that came from an arcade into a household name. It orignially
                came about in the 1970s and gained its popularity in the 1990s when it came bundled with the Nokia phones.
                The game is simple yet addictive, making it easy to pick up and play. It isnt complicated and just involves not colliding 
                with yourself and eating the food to grow bigger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though the game itself is basic, Snake became a cultural icon and introduced mobile gaming to the masses.
                It has remained popular over the years, with the game being recreated in various forms across different platforms.
                From a simple 2D game to modern 3D versions, the game has stuck to its roots while keeping up with modern tech.

                        This is a short youtube clip which shows a full run of the Snake game as it was played on the Nokia 3310.
                        The player moves the snake to consume food items, which in turn makes it grow longer.
                        The game gets more difficult as the snake grows, as you're more likely to crash into yourself or the walls.
                        The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible before crashing.
